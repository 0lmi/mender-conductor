If at any point you have questions or run into issues please do not hesitate to contact me (just reply to this email).

Known issues

Device decommissioning currently does not work properly, so any devices you add to Hosted Mender can not be removed.
This issue should be resolved within a day or two, no action is needed on your part.

Limitations

This beta environment is for testing purposes. Data saved there may not persist. If necessary, the environment may be decommissioned or reset after the beta period. We will announce plans to reset the environment in advance and work to make it possible for devices to be migrated to the Hosted Mender production environment.

We are monitoring the resource usage of the environment. If you plan to connect more than 10 devices simultaneously or upload more than 10 Artifacts, please let us know in advance. Your account may be suspended at any time due to indication of abuse.

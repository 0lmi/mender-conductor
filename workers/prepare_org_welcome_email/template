Hi,

Welcome to the Hosted Mender beta program!

Email: $email
Password: Set during signup. Contact us if you need to reset it.

Please login at https://hosted.mender.io.

We have several interactive tutorials for you to test Hosted Mender, and we recommend starting with the first one:


1) Deploy to virtual device (estimated time: 10 minutes)

There is one virtual device already connected to your account. There is also one Artifact for your virtual device already uploaded so you can start testing right away. Follow the onboarding help tips after you log in (click on the small question marks) to complete your first deployment with Mender!

Note that your virtual device expires in two weeks, so make sure to start testing soon! You may remove the existing demo Artifacts and decommission your virtual device when you are done testing this part.


2) Raspberry Pi 3 demo (estimated time: 20 minutes)

If you have a Raspberry Pi 3, you can use the images we have already built for your account.

Follow these steps to deploy updates to your Raspberry Pi 3 from Hosted Mender: https://hosted.mender.io/ui/#/help/connecting-devices/provision-a-demo/raspberry-pi-3


3) Beaglebone Black demo (estimated time: 20 minutes)

If you have a BeagleBone Black, you can use the images we have already built for your account.

Follow these steps to deploy updates to your BeagleBone Black from Hosted Mender: https://hosted.mender.io/ui/#/help/connecting-devices/provision-a-demo/beagleboneblack


4) Yocto Project integration

If you already have a Yocto Project build environment for your device, you can include Mender into it and enable OTA updates for your project using Hosted Mender.

Limitations

This beta environment is for testing purposes. Data saved there may not persist. If necessary, the environment may be decommissioned or reset after the beta period. We will announce plans to reset the environment in advance and work to make it possible for devices to be migrated to the Hosted Mender production environment.

We are monitoring the resource usage of the environment. If you plan to connect more than 10 devices simultaneously or upload more than 10 Artifacts, please let us know in advance. Your account may be suspended at any time due to indication of abuse.
